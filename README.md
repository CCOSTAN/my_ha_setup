This is the my Repo of my Home Assistant setup.  You will find more helpful ReadMe files in the directoies as you browse them.  I will keep this updated often. I decided to do this prodject since I have been helped by looking at others configurations. It is very unique to be able to see what others have done and copy them. Be sure to always star every repo that you look at to show that you used their information.

I use a configuration type called split configuration.  So my main configuration.yaml file is broken out into many different files located in the directories.  Be sure to visit the package directory where practically self contained YAML files exist that you can easily drop into your configurations to be up and running fast with various automations and components.
