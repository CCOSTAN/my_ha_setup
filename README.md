This is my first Repo. I am trying to learn how to do this github thing. You will find more links to code and things for Home Assitant contained in them.  I am constantly messing with my Home Assistant each day I will try to keep this updated as much as possible.  I use a configuration type called split configuration.  So my main configuration.yaml file is broken out into many different files located in the directories.  Once I load my config be sure to visit the package directory where all the YAML files exist.  </p>

First and foremost thanks all who have helped to make my conifg and system what it is. Here are links to the main repositories I have used. Please star their repos!!
