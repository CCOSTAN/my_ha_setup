# My Home Assistant Setup

This is my setup for my home automation system based on Home Assistant!
* Home Assistant Configuration files are now mostly located within [Packages directory]. I did this to organize them and make them easier to find and understan what they are used for. I followed this example: https://github.com/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig.
