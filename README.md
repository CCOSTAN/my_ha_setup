# My Home Assistant Setup

This is my setup for my home automation system based on Home Assistant!
* Home Assistant Configuration files are now mostly located within [Packages directory]. I did this to organize them and make them easier to find and understand what they are used for. I followed this example: https://github.com/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig. 

# Devices

My home automation system is run on an old PC that I bought second hand from a hospital at a sale.
PC specs:
   *Dell Optiplex790
   *Runs Proxmox as the operating system: https://www.proxmox.com/en/
