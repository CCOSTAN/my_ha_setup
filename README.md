My Home Assistant home automation Setup.

Hardware:
 I run my Home Assitant "server" on a n used Dell Optiplex 790. I know that it is over kill for just Home Assistant but I got it for practically nothing and
 it was very simple to setup and run.
 
Software:
 I run Home Assistant Supervised in a Proxmox VM. I used Wiskerz sript to install it as it was simple and it has been bullet proof. I did this as I can create other VMs and 
and other test instances or operating systems. I have had ZERO issues with it unless I mees with things that I shouldn't.
 
Input Devices:
 I started out my Home Automation journbey with an ECHO Plus and the Alexa echo system. i currently have 12 echos throughout the house and in my vehicle. I used to use them as the mode to do my automations. They are now just devices that say the things I want to say, allow for voice commands, and work with my security system.
