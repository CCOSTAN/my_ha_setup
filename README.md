This is the main directory of the Repo.  You will find more helpful Home Assistant related files in the directoies as you browse them.  I will always try to add more. I was helped by looking at others configuration. Thats my reasoning for putting my setup up for all to see. If you like something or see something I should change let me know. i might or might not do it, depeneding if it breaks my system.
I split configuration using packages.  So my main configuration.yaml file is broken out into many different files located in the packages file.  Be sure to visit the packages directory where YAML files exist that you can easily drop into your configurations to be up and running fast with automations, sensors and entities are organized. </p>
